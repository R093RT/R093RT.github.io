excerpt: 'Hyperaccumulators are plants with the ability to tolerate and accumulate high concentrations of potentially phytotoxic metals. The Australian legume Crotalaria novae-hollandiae accumulates remarkably high concentrations of zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) in its shoots when growing on metalliferous (Zn-Cd ‘calamine’) soils. This study aimed to investigate zinc-cadmium tolerance in C. novae-hollandiae and to compare it with the closely related, but non-metalliferous, C. cunninghamii.'
